      <h1>Principal Rules of DalsanTV</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to DalsanTV. The rules of DalsanTV are made for making the community comfortable.
        The rules are not made for make wars, and the mission is to moderate the entire website. Everyone needs to follow the rules
        of DalsanTV including normal users, secondary moderators, and primary moderators. If someone violates those rules, they will
        have the consequence that the admin or founder takes a punishment for the guilty.
      </p>
      <h1>Punishment methods applied for the guilty</h1>
      <p>
        If you recieve a ban, You are free to log out, log in, see content of every user and
        create a new account if this time you will promise to respect the actual rules of DalsanTV.
        If it was contradicted your promise and you back to violate the principal rules, people can
        report you as: "Ban Evasor".
      </p>
      <h2>Classic: Temporal Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Temporal bans makes you are unaviable to interact, see notifications, view other content of
        other users if you're logged in and even add, edit or delete multimedia content. This
        type of temporal bans are adjusted from 1 day to 12 months.
      </p>
      <h2>Classic: Permanent Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Is the same thing that you are unaviable to do that previous things, but you will not have the
        possibility of recover your account. So in this case, you're banned forever. If you think that
        we make a mistake on your ban and you didn't violate the main Rules, you can appeal directly
        to the admin, so it will check if its worth to unban your account or not.
      </p>
      <h2>Critical: IP Ban</h2>
      <p>
        This only happens in very critical behaviors on an account. IP is assigned so the website will
        detect the unauthorized ip and the user who has connected to the same IP, will have totally no
        access to the website forever. Only option: appeal that IP ban if we really make a mistake on
        the IP ban.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>The main Rules of DalsanTV</h1>
      <p>
        There is the real part in that I will explain all the rules of DalsanTV. Remember to follow this rules for
        not have any types of this ban. If you respect people by a large time and you moderate the people and following
        the main and principal rules of DalsanTV, you will have the rank to be a Secondary Moderator, or Primary Moderator
        depending on how much you apply this rules.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Moderator promotion</h2>
      <p>
        Moderators are people that applies correctly the principal rules of dalsania. Why its helpful? Admin will have less posibility for moderate an entire people.
        If there are many users using DalsanTV, the admin will take a lot of time moderating users and guessing who follows the principal rules of dalsania, so the best
        solution is the moderators collaborating with the admin for make apply the rules of DalsanTV.
      </p>
      <p>
        For promove from normal user to a moderator, you need to have 3 months of experience on DalsanTV, and you need to respect those rules during that test time.
        After it reaches the time, you will have the possibility of being a moderator, but the admin is the only person that will choose if promove to secondary moderator.
        Secondary moderators can also promove as Primary Moderators but only if they also focus on it's behavior and the community; The admin still the only person for
        promove.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moderators have the consequence of being demoted if they rebel in any way they think of doing it. If a moderator starts to violate the Principal Rules of DalsanTV
        even if they do this once for the Primary Moderators, the admin will just demote the guilty for demote any type of moderator back to a normal user starting again.
