      <h1>Punishment methods applied for the guilty</h1>

      <h2>Classic: Temporal Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Temporal bans makes you are unaviable to interact, see notifications, view other content of
        other users if you're logged in and even add, edit or delete multimedia content. This
        type of temporal bans are adjusted from 1 day to 12 months.
      </p>
      <h2>Classic: Permanent Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Is the same thing that you are unaviable to do that previous things, but you will not have the
        possibility of recover your account. So in this case, you're banned forever. If you think that
        we make a mistake on your ban and you didn't violate the main Rules, you can appeal directly
        to the admin, so it will check if its worth to unban your account or not.
      </p>
      <h2>Critical: IP Ban</h2>
      <p>
        This only happens in very critical behaviors on an account. IP is assigned so the website will
        detect the unauthorized ip and the user who has connected to the same IP, will have totally no
        access to the website forever. Only option: appeal that IP ban if we really make a mistake on
        the IP ban.
