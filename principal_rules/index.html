      <h1>Principal Rules of DalsanTV</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to DalsanTV. The rules of DalsanTV are made for making the community comfortable.
        The rules are not made for make wars, and the mission is to moderate the entire website. Everyone needs to follow the rules
        of DalsanTV including normal users, secondary moderators, and primary moderators. If someone violates those rules, they will
        have the consequence that the admin or founder takes a punishment for the guilty.
      </p>
      <h1>Punishment methods applied for the guilty</h1>
      <p>
        If you recieve a ban, You are free to log out, log in, see content of every user and
        create a new account if this time you will promise to respect the actual rules of DalsanTV.
        If it was contradicted your promise and you back to violate the principal rules, people can
        report you as: "Ban Evasor".
      </p>
      <h2>Classic: Temporal Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Temporal bans makes you are unaviable to interact, see notifications, view other content of
        other users if you're logged in and even add, edit or delete multimedia content. This
        type of temporal bans are adjusted from 1 day to 12 months.
      </p>
      <h2>Classic: Permanent Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Is the same thing that you are unaviable to do that previous things, but you will not have the
        possibility of recover your account. So in this case, you're banned forever. If you think that
        we make a mistake on your ban and you didn't violate the main Rules, you can appeal directly
        to the admin, so it will check if its worth to unban your account or not.
      </p>
      <h2>Critical: IP Ban</h2>
      <p>
        This only happens in very critical behaviors on an account. IP is assigned so the website will
        detect the unauthorized ip and the user who has connected to the same IP, will have totally no
        access to the website forever. Only option: appeal that IP ban if we really make a mistake on
        the IP ban.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>The main Rules of DalsanTV</h1>
      <p>
        There is the real part in that I will explain all the rules of DalsanTV. Remember to follow this rules for
        not have any types of this ban. If you respect people by a large time and you moderate the people and following
        the main and principal rules of DalsanTV, you will have the rank to be a Secondary Moderator, or Primary Moderator
        depending on how much you apply this rules.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Moderator promotion</h2>
      <p>
        Moderators are people that applies correctly the principal rules of dalsania. Why its helpful? Admin will have less posibility for moderate an entire people.
        If there are many users using DalsanTV, the admin will take a lot of time moderating users and guessing who follows the principal rules of dalsania, so the best
        solution is the moderators collaborating with the admin for make apply the rules of DalsanTV.
      </p>
      <p>
        For promove from normal user to a moderator, you need to have 3 months of experience on DalsanTV, and you need to respect those rules during that test time.
        After it reaches the time, you will have the possibility of being a moderator, but the admin is the only person that will choose if promove to secondary moderator.
        Secondary moderators can also promove as Primary Moderators but only if they also focus on it's behavior and the community; The admin still the only person for
        promove.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moderators have the consequence of being demoted if they rebel in any way they think of doing it. If a moderator starts to violate the Principal Rules of DalsanTV
        even if they do this once for the Primary Moderators, the admin will just demote the guilty for demote any type of moderator back to a normal user starting again.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Blocking Rules</h2>
      <p>
        In other sites you can block an user by any reason, but in DalsanTV, blocking an user is controlled by the admin and the moderators; so in this site, blocking an user
        will not stop to interact with this user. The admin will controll your block in three types: Total, Partial and Unable; this three types of blocking will apply for the
        targeted user. You cannot block the admin by any reason and this is the same case with the moderators. If any user blocks some mentioned user, you can block a 100%,
        be a partial block or unable to block this mentioned user. Anybody can not see if this user was targeted for know which type of block has now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Total Block. Total block is the most common of blocking an user and this type of block is applied for all new users by default. The blocker will just block the user,
        it confirms if block this user. If it accepts the block, both blocker and the blocked user will not interact, view or follow mutualy until the blocker changes his/her
        opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Partial Block. Partial block is applied by the users who act normal and had followed the rules of DalsanTV; partial blocks will only be targeted by the Admin and the
        moderators. If the blocker blocks the blocked user, are only unable to interact and follow mutually, but they can still be able to watch his/her content, profile
        and description; not to see his/her followers and to favourite it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unable Block. The blocker can not block an user by any reason, even if it's fair by him/her opinion. The admin can only control if target the user as unable to block,
        but moderators cannot do this thing. Admins, Moderators and super-users can not be blocked by any reason. If the Blocker wants to block an user, it will just appear
        a warning that says: "You can not block this user", knewing that this user can not be blocked.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Rule Conservatism</h2>
      <p>
        The rules of DalsanTV needs to be conservated forever and a modification to a rule on DalsanTV will not be tolerated. So, this site needs to have the same rules and
        if the admin adds a rule, that rule is applied and no one including moderators cannot justify the admin if this rule needs to be added or if it's not recomendable.
        The future is unpredictable and only God knows what will happen. It needs to have a leal and conservatist sucessor of DalsanTV if the actual admin is not having a
        good health. If some rule is changed after the sucessor, the community will have rights to kick out the sucessor.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Not tolerant to Political topics</h2>
      <p>
        The site was made for enjoy the community for make relevant and featured videos, songs, images, characters, etc. DalsanTV is not made for talk about politics. If we
        found an user talking about politics, it will let into a permanent ban for not follow the main rules of community of DalsanTV. You can make images, videos or everything
        about of characters having a flag like for express your national country, but is not for talk about politics.
      </p>
      <h2>5. LGBTIQ+ is totally forbidden</h2>
      <p>
        I will soon talk about of this rule.
