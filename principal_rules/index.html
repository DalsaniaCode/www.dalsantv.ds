      <h1>Principal Rules of DalsanTV</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to DalsanTV. The rules of DalsanTV are made for making the community comfortable.
        The rules are not made for make wars, and the mission is to moderate the entire website. Everyone needs to follow the rules
        of DalsanTV including normal users, secondary moderators, and primary moderators. If someone violates those rules, they will
        have the consequence that the admin or founder takes a punishment for the guilty.
      </p>
      <h1>Punishment methods applied for the guilty</h1>
      <p>
        If you recieve a ban, You are free to log out, log in, see content of every user and
        create a new account if this time you will promise to respect the actual rules of DalsanTV.
        If it was contradicted your promise and you back to violate the principal rules, people can
        report you as: "Ban Evasor".
      </p>
      <h2>Classic: Temporal Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Temporal bans makes you are unaviable to interact, see notifications, view other content of
        other users if you're logged in and even add, edit or delete multimedia content. This
        type of temporal bans are adjusted from 1 day to 12 months.
      </p>
      <h2>Classic: Permanent Ban</h2>
      <p>
        Is the same thing that you are unaviable to do that previous things, but you will not have the
        possibility of recover your account. So in this case, you're banned forever. If you think that
        we make a mistake on your ban and you didn't violate the main Rules, you can appeal directly
        to the admin, so it will check if its worth to unban your account or not.
      </p>
      <h2>Critical: IP Ban</h2>
      <p>
        This only happens in very critical behaviors on an account. IP is assigned so the website will
        detect the unauthorized ip and the user who has connected to the same IP, will have totally no
        access to the website forever. Only option: appeal that IP ban if we really make a mistake on
        the IP ban.
      </p>
      <h2>Moderative: Inmovilization</h2>
      <p>
        Inmovilizate an account is temporal by default. Inmovilizate an account will make it unaviable to publish, comment, favourite, edit, follow and any form of iteraction, but it
        can still watching his/her profile, other profiles and watch videos without problem. Is the same as the Bans, but this will not afect the visibility of another user and is
        like mute an user and not interact, but still seeing the content.
      </p>
      <h2>Moderative: Followers Partition</h2>
      <p>
        This will make that your followers on your account will stop being followed automatically without prior notice depending how is the magnitude assigned by the admin. If its
        50%, a 50% of your followers will be unfollowed, and 0% will unfollow all of your followers. Your followers selected will be unfollowed randomly.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>The main Rules of DalsanTV</h1>
      <p>
        There is the real part in that I will explain all the rules of DalsanTV. Remember to follow this rules for
        not have any types of this ban. If you respect people by a large time and you moderate the people and following
        the main and principal rules of DalsanTV, you will have the rank to be a Secondary Moderator, or Primary Moderator
        depending on how much you apply this rules.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Moderator promotion</h2>
      <p>
        Moderators are people that applies correctly the principal rules of dalsania. Why its helpful? Admin will have less posibility for moderate an entire people.
        If there are many users using DalsanTV, the admin will take a lot of time moderating users and guessing who follows the principal rules of dalsania, so the best
        solution is the moderators collaborating with the admin for make apply the rules of DalsanTV.
      </p>
      <p>
        For promove from normal user to a moderator, you need to have 3 months of experience on DalsanTV, and you need to respect those rules during that test time.
        After it reaches the time, you will have the possibility of being a moderator, but the admin is the only person that will choose if promove to secondary moderator.
        Secondary moderators can also promove as Primary Moderators but only if they also focus on it's behavior and the community; The admin still the only person for
        promove.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moderators have the consequence of being demoted if they rebel in any way they think of doing it. If a moderator starts to violate the Principal Rules of DalsanTV
        even if they do this once for the Primary Moderators, the admin will just demote the guilty for demote any type of moderator back to a normal user starting again.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Blocking Rules</h2>
      <p>
        In other sites you can block an user by any reason, but in DalsanTV, blocking an user is controlled by the admin and the moderators; so in this site, blocking an user
        will not stop to interact with this user. The admin will controll your block in three types: Total, Partial and Unable; this three types of blocking will apply for the
        targeted user. You cannot block the admin by any reason and this is the same case with the moderators. If any user blocks some mentioned user, you can block a 100%,
        be a partial block or unable to block this mentioned user. Anybody can not see if this user was targeted for know which type of block has now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Total Block. Total block is the most common of blocking an user and this type of block is applied for all new users by default. The blocker will just block the user,
        it confirms if block this user. If it accepts the block, both blocker and the blocked user will not interact, view or follow mutualy until the blocker changes his/her
        opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Partial Block. Partial block is applied by the users who act normal and had followed the rules of DalsanTV; partial blocks will only be targeted by the Admin and the
        moderators. If the blocker blocks the blocked user, are only unable to interact and follow mutually, but they can still be able to watch his/her content, profile
        and description; not to see his/her followers and to favourite it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unable Block. The blocker can not block an user by any reason, even if it's fair by him/her opinion. The admin can only control if target the user as unable to block,
        but moderators cannot do this thing. Admins, Moderators and super-users can not be blocked by any reason. If the Blocker wants to block an user, it will just appear
        a warning that says: "You can not block this user", knewing that this user can not be blocked.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Rule Conservatism</h2>
      <p>
        The rules of DalsanTV needs to be conservated forever and a modification to a rule on DalsanTV will not be tolerated. So, this site needs to have the same rules and
        if the admin adds a rule, that rule is applied and no one including moderators cannot justify the admin if this rule needs to be added or if it's not recomendable.
        The future is unpredictable and only God knows what will happen. It needs to have a leal and conservatist sucessor of DalsanTV if the actual admin is not having a
        good health. If some rule is changed after the sucessor, the community will have rights to kick out the sucessor.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Not tolerant to Political topics</h2>
      <p>
        The site was made for enjoy the community for make relevant and featured videos, songs, images, characters, etc. DalsanTV is not made for talk about politics. If we
        found an user talking about politics, it will let into a permanent ban for not follow the main rules of community of DalsanTV. You can make images, videos or everything
        about of characters having a flag like for express your national country, but is not for talk about politics.
      </p>
      <h2>5. LGBTIQ+ celebrity is forbidden</h2>
      <p>
        This rule is totally serious at this moment. Gay and Lesbian people are welcome on DalsanTV including Trans people, but only if they put his/her natural gender or
        cisgender form. Bisexual people are even more welcome. LGBTIQ+ can go and have an account to this website normally. The only condition that this community have is
        not to celebrate Pride Month and not to show any reference of LGBTIQ+ kiss. If the admin caughts you publishing Gay or Lesbian kiss in any multimedia (Videos,
        Stream, Images) the content will be excluded on DalsanTV. Characters with a LGBTIQ+ flag are tolerated, but the case changes when it's in a large scale and too
        much content of this type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trans people are forced to put the cisgender gender during the account creation. If the admin caughts an user having a Illegal gender, it can be reported as: "Ilicit
        Gender" and then, DalsanTV will change the gender to the real one. People who are hemaphrodite and are born being intengender, I mean: Intersexual Cisgender people,
        sadly, there is not an option for the intersexual people. They need to put his/her favourite gender; people who are genderfluid it gets more complicated.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Sign up Rules</h2>
      <p>
        This part will not tell about the principal instructions about how to sign up to DalsanTV, but this rule will say after you put your three inputs for create an account.
        You need to tell your real country for express your nation. That's not all, this can help to know the legal adult age, for example, the Explicit Adult age is +18 years
        old, but depending in your country, this can change to +20 years old, or +19 years old. Countries that are not aviable to this site, will not appear in the list of
        countries during the sign up process. If the admin saws that you're lying, the admin can change your nation to the real one. This doesn't apply to people that are
        migrated to another country.
      </p>
      <p>
        After put your country or nation, For sign up, you need to put your gender. There are two options for choose your gender: Male and Female. There's also a option of:
        "I prefer don't say it" if you want it. After put your gender, you can not change your gender in your account; only the admin can change it. If you are transgender,
        you're not allowed to put your changed gender. For example: You're a Transfemale, you can not put the gender as female. Instead, put the gender as male because you're
        Transfemale; You're a Transmale, you can not put the gender as male. female because you're Transmale. If your gender had really born as intergender, there's no a legal
        option for that. The solution is not to tell your gender (if you're I.genderfluid) or put your favourite or common gender (if you're not).
      </p>
      <p>
        To end the process of sign up, you need to tell your birthday. This will help for not show content not suitable for minors. You can sign up your account if you age is
        over or equals to 10 years old, or sign up with your parent birthday only if your parents check what you are watching. If you're under 10 years and you're watching
        content not suitable for minors, your account can be punished to a permanent block of your account. You can not change your birthday after sign up to your account.
        After this steps, you created your account.
      </p>
      <h2>7. AI use is totally forbidden</h2>
      <p>
        Videos, Streaming, Musics and Art generated with Artificial Intelligence is not tolerated on DalsanTV. There's no chance to tag a content as created with Artificial
        Intelligence. This AI prohibition is for avoid confusing real or manual multimedia with fake, false and AI generated multimedia. If an user was reported using AI tools,
        the Admin will permanent ban this user if it has a AI generated multimedia, even if there's only one content made with AI. AI supporting is also not OK on DalsanTV
        and this will happen the same case: Permanent Block.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Real Meme Verification</h2>
      <p>
        If you tag your published content as: "Meme", the admin will verify in all sense if this content is really humoristic, it's funny and some features that it haves a
        real Meme. If the verification has ended and the admin had confirmed that this is a real meme, the content under the Title will appear a purple: "MEME" text in a
        Purple square; if the admin confirms that the meme is not a real meme (Not funny, just common thing or content with banned content), your content that was tagged as
        a meme, will automatically untag as a "Meme" and it will not appear the Purple verification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Requesting or call the admin for verify a content as a meme is allowed once the admin had verified and end the Real Meme proccess on the content, but it cannot request
        to the admin too much times or else this can lead into a inmovilization to your account.
      </p>
      <h2>9. Age labeling</h2>
      <p>
        Each time that you publish a Video, Stream, Art or Comic will request you a age labeling. The principal age Labeling are: [E: Everyone, D: Medials (+10), T: Teens (+13)
        M: Mature (+16)]. After you select the requested age labeling, it doesn't mean that your content will have explicitly that label you request. It will be labeled
        automatically as: "Rating Pending" for avoid false age labeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The users will vote which age labeling is the most appropiate for the published content. The common users have 1 point for one vote, Moderators have 5 points for one vote
        and the Administrator have 20 points for one vote, or it can manually put the predeterminated age labeling explicitly; if the vote had reached more than 15 votes, the most
        voted age labeling will be applied for the content that the user had published.
      </p>
      <p>
        Age labeling is unaviable by default during the April month because it can falsify a vote on purpose; thing that the admin doesn't allow because the age labeling
        it's made for put suitable content depending on the age of each user.
      </p>
      <h2>10. Aviable languages</h2>
      <p>
        The aviable languages for DalsanTV are English and Spanish. This page was started in english, but it has a lingual problem and there may be both ortoghraphical errors
        and grammar errors on each site of DalsanTV. Also, spanish is not aviable by now and this can lead into much questions. The site is only in english language now.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to collaborate to translate this site, come to my <a href="https://github.com/DalsaniaCode/www.dalsantv.ds">Repository</a> for make this project more fast,
        but before to translate all the pages, I will make a pool or a vote of which structure needs to be applied the site translation.
      </p>
      <h2>11. Comment moderation</h2>
      <p>
        Comment is a common way for interact with an user in each social media. You are free to comment or tell to someone what you want by now, but if we found offensive or
        swear comments, or even banned words that are not allowed by the admin, this can lead into a 5 minute inmovilization. If you say this type of dirty comments too
        commonly, this can lead into a temporal ban depending on the severity. This comment moderation is also applied with both English and Spanish language; comments considered
        not offensive by some regions but containing a forbidden word, will still violating the rules and will fall in the same case of 5 minute inmovilization. We can not tell
        which are this words for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        We check the comment for not found bad matterial or bad iteractions thanks for the primary moderators, the admin and the automatic detector. Each comment will start
        normally; moderators and the admin will inspect if the comment can be accepted for your actual interaction or for all DalsanTV. If we found that your comment is ok,
        then your comment will have a green circle with a white verification symbol under your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comments circunvating swear words censoring with a symbol, replace it with a innofensive word or communicating with a code technique, is still not a solution. Some
        symbols are not compatible with DalsanTV and there was the principal reason of why you cannot censore. Commenting emojis on DalsanTV are unaviable because it doesn't
        have the capacity of commenting this type of very special symbols.
      </p>
      <h2>12. Content Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone can publish each type of multimedia, but it needs to follow an important rule for not avoid serial problems on DalsanTV. You're not allowed to publish content
        that is excesfully weird or non-sense because this can lead into a permanent block of your account if this type of content gets too common on your account; you're not
        allowed to stole content of another user without it's permission, and this also applies with "PUBLIC" content that it was not requested by music or movie companies or
        not founded by the original author. Violating those rules will make your specific content being excluded of DalsanTV.
      </p>
      <p>
        Publish content with swear and offensive words will make your video being muted in specific parts, while the other parts will not be affected. Broke the 11th rule visually
        on a Video, Stream, Image and Comic will edit and modify the content by the admin for censore everything that it's not ok with DalsanTV. Videos that get more popular
        than the admin will make your video be excluded.
